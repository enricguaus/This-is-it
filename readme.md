THIS IS IT

Over the Summer of 2019 we were asked to think up a Fluxus inspired event for an evening at a gallery/salon. This brought us to explore music making as an act of filtering and shaping sound (or space). So we designed a feedback system that we continue to develop for live performance. To excite the room (and the event) we were to use a simple doodle of a piece reminiscent of Cageâ€™s text pieces. The score is essentially an annotated text. Performance is It.
